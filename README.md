Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve image classification tasks. CNNs are widely used in computer vision and pattern recognition due to their ability to automatically learn features from images.

Project Features

Data Preprocessing: Techniques like normalization, resizing, and augmentation applied to input images.

Model Architecture: A CNN model built with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Training and Validation: Model training using a labeled dataset, with validation to monitor performance.

Evaluation: Model accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for performance analysis.

Visualization: Loss and accuracy plotted over epochs, and sample predictions visualized.


Datasets

The project uses SVHN, consisting of labeled images. The dataset is preprocessed using techniques like resizing and normalization.

Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:

1. Input Layer: Preprocessed image data.
2. Convolutional Layers: Extract features using filters.
3. Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features.
4. Fully Connected Layers: Final layers for classification.
5. Output Layer: Softmax activation for predicting classes.
